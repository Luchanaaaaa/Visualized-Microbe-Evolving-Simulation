# Visualized-Microbe-Evolving-Simulation
This is an Visualized Microbe Evolving Simulation  Based on Evolutionary Dynamics.    
As demonstrated in the implementation section and in the test results, the project successfully 
implemented all designed models and a fully compliant evolutionary process.
For ease of use, the software supports the user to easily modify the values in the user 
interface and view the data generated by the model evolution process.

>In nature, organisms undergo neutral or non-neutral mutations in their genes when they 
reproduce. Mutations in an individual may spread to the entire population or disappear. The 
process is influenced by both natural selection and random drift. Nevertheless, evolution is 
not entirely beneficial, as in the case of cancer, where malignant cells multiply and normal 
cells die.
Based on evolutionary graph dynamics and in order to investigate the effects of different 
population structures on evolution, this project abstracts the structure of biological 
populations and the evolutionary process, using computers to construct simulations of 
different evolutionary models and their evolutionary processes.
By using the modelling implemented in this project, the effects of different population 
structures on the rate of evolution are explored.
